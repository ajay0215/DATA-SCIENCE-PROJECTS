# DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS

1)[HACKATHON- OLD CAR PRICE PREDICTION](https://github.com/ajay0215/DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECTS/blob/main/AJAY%20hackathon.ipynb) CONDUCTED BY GREAT LAKES INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT
•	The objective is to predict the price of an old car based on the features given in the dataset which yields the lowest RMSE. Finished in the TOP5 among many who participated. Key skills: Linear Regression ,  Ensemble techniques 

2)[Fake news detection on the REVIDLY application](https://github.com/ajay0215/DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECTS/blob/main/Revidly.ipynb)The objective is to find the most fake words and most real words the users are using in the various articles of the REVIDLY  application. After cleaning the data ,Text pre processing such as stemming and lemmatization is done .I used a TFIDF vectorizer to convert the words into n columns of arrays. Various algorithms were applied.89 percent accuracy was obtained using Naive bayes classifier.
Key skills: Sklearn, seaborn, Classification models – NLP, Lemmatization, TFIDF vectorizer, Multinomial NB, CART, Random Forest , Ensemble techniques
