# DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS

1)[HACKATHON- OLD CAR PRICE PREDICTION](https://github.com/ajay0215/DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECTS/blob/main/AJAY%20hackathon.ipynb) CONDUCTED BY GREAT LAKES INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT
•	The objective is to predict the price of an old car based on the features given in the dataset which yields the lowest RMSE. Finished in the TOP5 among many who participated. Key skills: Linear Regression ,  Ensemble techniques 

2)[Fake news detection on the REVIDLY application](https://github.com/ajay0215/DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECTS/blob/main/REVIDLY%20Fake%20news%20classifier.ipynb)The objective is to find the most fake words and most real words the users are using in the various articles of the REVIDLY  application. After cleaning the data ,Text pre processing such as stemming and lemmatization is done .I used a TFIDF vectorizer to convert the words into n columns of arrays. Various algorithms were applied.89 percent accuracy was obtained using Naive bayes classifier.
Key skills: Sklearn, seaborn, Classification models – NLP, Lemmatization, TFIDF vectorizer, Multinomial NB, CART, Random Forest , Ensemble techniques 

3)[Brain tumour detection using CNN](https://github.com/ajay0215/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Brain%20Tumor%20Detection%20using%20CNN.py) The main objective is  to train and apply a simple CNN to differentiate between an MRI with a Tumor and an MRI without one.In this, we want to classify an MRI scan of a patient’s brain obtained as whether there is a presence of tumor or not. we will build a classification model that would take MRI images of the patient and compute if there is a tumor in the brain or not. We will first build the model using simple custom layers convolutional neural networks and then evaluate it. At last, we will compute some prediction by the model and compare the results. 
Key skills: keras,CNN,numpy,pandas,sklearn
